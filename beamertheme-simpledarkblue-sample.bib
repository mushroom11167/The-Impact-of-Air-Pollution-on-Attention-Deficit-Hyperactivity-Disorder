 TI  - The worldwide prevalence of ADHD: is it an American condition?
 PG  - 104-13
 AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder that
 affects up to 1 in 20 children in the USA. The predominance of American research
 into this disorder over the past 40 years has led to the impression that ADHD is
 largely an American disorder and is much less prevalent elsewhere. This
 impression was reinforced by the perception that ADHD may stem from social and
 cultural factors that are most common in American society. However, another
 school of thought suggested that ADHD is a behavioral disorder common to children
 of many different races and societies worldwide, but that is not recognized by
 the medical community, perhaps due to confusion regarding its diagnosis and/or
 misconceptions regarding its adverse impact on children, their families, and
 society as a whole. In this article we present the available data, with a view to
 determining the worldwide prevalence of ADHD. A total of 50 studies were
 identified from a MEDLINE search for the terms ADHD, ADD, HKD, or
 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and prevalence combined, for the years
 1982 to 2001. 20 were studies in US populations and 30 were in non-US
 populations. Analysis of these studies suggests that the prevalence of ADHD is at
 least as high in many non-US children as in US children, with the highest
 prevalence rates being seen when using DSM-IV diagnoses. Recognition that ADHD is
 not purely an American disorder and that the prevalence of this behavioral
 disorder in many countries is in the same range as that in the USA will have
 important implications for the psychiatric care of children.
